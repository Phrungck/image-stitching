# Simple exercise of stitching image pairs (2020 coding-style)

In this programming task, the objective is to use the OpenCV libraries to stitch two images together to form a panoramic image. We aim to implement image stitching
from scratch which uses Harris corner detector as the feature detector.Additionally, RANSAC algorithm is also used to retrieve a homography mapping of one image into the other.
